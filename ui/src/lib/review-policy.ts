/**
 * Copy for an issue's `reviewPolicy` (PAP-16506 P4).
 *
 * `in_review` means the work needs a verdict, and by default anyone with write
 * access can give it — people and agents alike, including the agent that did the
 * work. That default needs no UI at all: it is what every issue already does,
 * and there is no control for changing it. Only an agent sets the column, and
 * only the two opt-in constraints are worth showing:
 *
 * - `not_creator` — "Anyone else": the reviewer must not be the requester.
 * - `human_only` — "Human only": an agent cannot give the verdict.
 *
 * A `null` or `"anyone"` column renders nothing. Every surface that shows the
 * policy routes through {@link issueReviewPolicyBadge} so the review card, the
 * issue properties row, and the activity receipt cannot drift from each other or
 * from the server's refusal copy in `server/src/services/issue-review-policy.ts`.
